    %h1 This is our abstract initiative.
    %p So here's what I think we're trying to do: We're trying to provide a root system for artists of all kinds. A system for artists to gather and both collect, and deliver "nutrients" (opportunities, networking, jobs, other artists, etc.). Essentially, we want to grow a healthy tree, or a healthy, efficient network for artists to be artists.
    %p  I agree. However, I also think that we should have an element of exclusivity. We're not trying to be deviant art. Yes, we are trying to foster growth and networking/collaboration between artists, but I don't think this is a thing that should be wide open to the public. The people that we choose to involve should be selected carefully. They do not need to hold similar ideals to us/ the rest of the group, but they should mesh in some way.
